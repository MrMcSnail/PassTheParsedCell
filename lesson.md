- Dave Lister (Craig Charles)
- Cat (Danny-John Jules)

## Androids

The character of *Kryton* is an example of a humanoid robot, or **android**. Originally, a personal household domestic assistant, dubbed 'The bog-bot from Hell,' by Arnold Rimmer, Kryton reveals himself as the crew member with the greatest amount of wisdom.

This is due to his superior synthetic neural network. Here is an example of the `boot` code he runs on start-up:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Initializing start-up sequence for Kryton..."

# Check if system files are present
if [ ! -f /etc/kryton/config.txt ]; then
  echo "Error: System configuration file not found."
  exit 1
fi

# Load configuration
source /etc/kryton/config.txt

# Start core services
/etc/init.d/kryton-core start

# Activate sensors
/etc/init.d/kryton-sensors start

# Initiate communication protocols
/etc/init.d/kryton-communication start

# Start user interface
/etc/init.d/kryton-ui start

echo "Kryton start-up sequence complete."

```
